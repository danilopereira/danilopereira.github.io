    <h1>Hi, Danilo Pereira here!</h1>
    <p>I'm a Brazilian Software Developer living in Berlin.</p>

    <p>
        What can I say about me?

        It's pretty difficult to talk about yourself, but let me try it shortly.

        As mentioned before, I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer. To be more specific, I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil and the third one in the world.
        I come to German with an opportunity to work but I used it to realize an old dream of a life abroad.
        My patient wife and I moved here to try this amazing city and know a new culture and here are us.

        I have been working with Software development since 2012, experiencing different industries and technologies. 
        Most of the time, I worked with Java in the backend, but I have one foot on PHP and my heart in Python.

        I love to talk about technology having a nice beer. I'm an agile passionate that loves SCRUM and that will try to convince you all the time about the advantages of this amazing process.

        If you want to know about my experiences, take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pereiradanilo/?locale=en_US">Linkedin</a> or my <a href="https://twitter.com/danilopereirait">Twitter</a>
